# Design Decisions - E-Waste Collection & Recycling Tracking System

## 1. Database Structure

- **Normalized Tables (3NF)**:  
  All tables were designed in Third Normal Form to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Each table has clearly defined primary keys and foreign keys to enforce relational integrity.

- **Entities Overview**:  
  - `Users`: Stores Admin, Collector, and Recycler information.  
  - `E-Waste Items`: Tracks items by category, condition, and registration date.  
  - `Collection Records`: Logs collection events including user, item, date, and location.  
  - `Audit Log`: Maintains a record of all INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations for accountability.  

- **ER Diagram**:  
  Include a clear ER diagram here (e.g., `ER_diagram.png`) showing all relationships.

## 2. Business Rules Implementation

- **Triggers**:  
  - Restrict collection inserts on weekdays and public holidays.  
  - Automatically log all changes to `collection_records` and `ewaste_items`.  
- **Rationale**: Ensures compliance with environmental collection schedules without manual monitoring.

## 3. PL/SQL Packages & Procedures

- **Modularity**: Grouped related functions, procedures, and validation logic into packages.  
- **Procedures & Functions**:  
  - Validation functions for user input  
  - Collection recording procedures with input checks  
  - Reporting procedures for analytics  

- **Performance Optimization**:  
  - Explicit cursors and bulk operations used for multi-row processing.  
  - Window functions for ranking and trend analysis.

## 4. Analytics & Business Intelligence

- **Fact & Dimension Tables**:  
  - Fact: `collection_records`  
  - Dimensions: `users`, `ewaste_items`  
- **BI Goals**:  
  - Track top collectors  
  - Identify most collected items by category  
  - Monitor trends by week/month  
- **Diagrams**:  
  Include mockup dashboards with charts, KPI cards, and graphs for visual representation.

## 5. Security & Access Control

- Role-based operations:
  - Admin: Full access  
  - Collector: Insert collections  
  - Recycler: Read-only access for analysis  
- Triggers enforce restrictions automatically, enhancing security and data integrity.

---

## 6. Additional Design Considerations

- **Audit Trail**: Ensures traceability of every operation.  
- **Scalability**: The database can support hundreds of users and thousands of collections.  
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new categories, locations, or user roles in the future.  

**Conclusion:**  
The system design emphasizes **accuracy, reliability, and scalability**, while providing a foundation for **real-time analytics** and **BI dashboards**.
