## **2. Project Innovation (Major Grading Component)**

### **Innovation Title**

### **Smart Compliance & Environmental Impact Engine using PL/SQL**

---

### **2.1 Innovation Overview**

The main innovation of this project is the transformation of the Oracle database into an **intelligent decision-making engine**.

Instead of simply storing data, the database:

* Evaluates user behavior
* Enforces environmental rules
* Calculates environmental impact
* Generates compliance scores automatically

All intelligence is implemented **inside Oracle using PL/SQL**, without relying on external applications.

---

### **2.2 Problem Addressed by the Innovation**

Traditional e-waste systems face the following problems:

* No automatic enforcement of rules
* Manual monitoring of collectors
* No measurement of environmental impact
* Limited support for decision-making

This innovation directly solves these challenges.

---

### **2.3 Innovation Components**

#### **A. Eco-Compliance Scoring Engine**

Each collector is assigned an **Eco Score (0–100)** based on behavior.

**Scoring Factors:**

* Allowed collection days
* Number of violations
* Type of items collected
* Frequency of compliant actions

**PL/SQL Implementation:**

* Functions calculate scores
* Triggers update scores automatically
* Audit logs record all activities

📌 This promotes accountability and responsible behavior.

---

#### **B. Environmental Impact Estimation**

Each e-waste item is assigned an **environmental risk weight**.

Example:

* Battery → High risk
* Laptop → Medium risk
* Phone → Lower risk

PL/SQL functions calculate:

* Total environmental damage prevented
* Impact per collector
* Monthly sustainability metrics

📌 This introduces **environmental awareness at database level**.

---

#### **C. Automatic Compliance Enforcement**

Triggers prevent:

* Collections on restricted days
* Repeated policy violations

All attempts are:

* Blocked automatically
* Logged in the audit table
* Reported in BI dashboards

📌 This removes dependency on human supervision.

---

### **2.4 Why This Innovation Is Exceptional**

* Uses advanced PL/SQL features
* Solves a real-world environmental problem
* Fully automated
* Scalable and auditable
* Supports analytics and BI

This innovation demonstrates **deep understanding of database intelligence**, not just CRUD operations.
